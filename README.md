# LGLoc

LGLoc is a bioinformatics tool designed for mRNA localization prediction using a combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), BERT model, and secondary structure analysis.

---

## 📦 Installation

Before running LGLoc, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Performance Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of LGLoc on a dataset, use the following command:

```bash
python performance_evaluation.py
```

Make sure to set the correct dataset path inside the script or via configuration.

---

## 🧠 GNN and BERT Models

The `Models` folder contains the original implementation of:

- Graph Neural Network (GNN)
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

### 🔧 Usage

You can train these models on the provided LGLoc dataset or your own dataset.

### 📥 Pretrained Weights

Pretrained weights are available in the `Model weights` directory. You can load these to avoid retraining from scratch.

---

## 🔬 Secondary Structure Prediction

The secondary structures used in LGLoc are stored in the `predicted secondary structures` folder and were predicted using the [ViennaRNA Package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/).

To predict secondary structure for your own RNA sequences:

```python
import RNA

seq = 'AAACCCGGGUUU'  # Replace with your sequence
structure, energy = RNA.fold(seq)
print(structure)
```

---

## 📊 Feature Vectors
- CKSNAP features are stored in the CKSNAP features folder.
- K-mer encodings are available in the K-mer Encoder folder.
- GNN and BERT features are stored in the `Feature vectors from GNN and BERT` folder, these features are generated using trained GNN and BERT models.

### 🛠 Generate Your Own Features

To generate feature vectors on a custom dataset:

```bash
python GNN.py         # For GNN features
python Splice_Bert.py # For BERT features
```

Ensure you configure your dataset path correctly in each script.
