# LGLoc
LGLoc: The predictor of mRNA subcellular localization based on BERT and Graph Neural Network Encoder
First you need to install requirements of LGloc by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
To see the performance of LGloc run performance_evaluation.py with correct dataset path.

``` 
python performance_evaluation.py

```
Model Folder contains orginal Graph Neural Network model and Bert model, you can train these models on the LGloc dataset or your own dataset path.

# Some Point about Feature vectors:
- The GNN and Bert Features which included in the gnn and bert feature folder generated by using trained Graph Neural Network and Bert models, So you can Generate this features by runing GNN.py or splice_bert.py which trained these models on your own dataset or LGloc dataset path.
- if you use any part of our model please cite to our LGloc paper.
