# LGLoc
First you need to install requirements of LGloc by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
To see the performance of LGloc run performance_evaluation.py with correct dataset path.

``` 
python performance_evaluation.py

```
# GNN and BERT 
Model Folder contains orginal Graph Neural Network model and BERT model, you can train these models on the LGloc dataset or your own dataset path.
GNN and BERT weight are put into Model weights folder, you can load these weights if you want to use our trained GNN and BERT models
# Secondary structure
All Secondary structures of LGloc model are put on the Secondary structure folder which pridected by using ViennaRNA Package. if you want to pridect your own dataset secondary structure run:

```
import RNA
seq = 'AAACCCGGGTTT' # or your sequence
fold = RNA.fold(seq)
print(fold)
```
#Point about feature vectors:
- The GNN and Bert features which included in the gnn and bert feature folder generated by using trained Graph Neural Network and Bert models, So you can Generate this features by runing GNN.py or splice_bert.py which train these models on your own dataset or LGloc dataset path.
if you use any part of our model please cite to our LGloc paper.
